NoJS Vite + Tailwind CSS Starter
====
Scaffold a new project with Vite and Tailwind CSS preconfigured with ease.

## Motivation

Most existing Vite + Tailwind starters are aimed to work with a JS framework, e.g Vue or React.
An important difference of this starter template is that the build stage does not involve any JavaScript, just pure HTML/CSS compilation.

## When to use

1. When you need to develop a pure HTML/CSS prototype.
2. When you import a standalone version of a JS framework right from HTML.

## How to use

```bash
npx degit kometolabs/vite-tailwind-nojs-starter my-tailwind-app
cd my-tailwind-app
pnpm i || yarn || npm i
pnpm run dev || yarn dev || npm run dev
```

**Happy coding!**
